## Why Use Vessel?

The Vessel API is a Unified CRM API that provides standardized endpoints for performing operations on common CRM Objects. Vessel also provides a drop-in FE authentication component that handles connecting to your customer's CRMs. Once you've setup Vessel, your customers will automatically gain access to CRMs as we add support for them with no additional code needed.
